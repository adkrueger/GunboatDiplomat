All features on our website are relatively self explanatory and can be 
used by simply clicking a button Those that are not are explained 
below.

Appending a local video segment: Local video segments can be appended
to a playlist by either searching for the video segment or by acting
upon it from the list. These can then be appended by clicking the
Append to Playlist button and entering the playlist name you would like
to append the video segment to.

Appending a remote video segment: To append a remote, one must first 
search for the remote. Once it appears, click the "Append to Playlist" 
button and enter the playlist name you wish to append the remote video 
segment to.

Searching video segments is an "and/or" type of search. If you enter 
just a character then it will only search for a character, which is 
the same for a quote. If you enter both, the search will search for 
both substrings.

Removing a video segment: Click Remove VS button, then enter the index
of the video segment you would like to remove (starting at 0).

Uploading and deleting from the library takes a moment, as the S3 bucket
needs to "warm up".

Uploaded video segments are displayed in alphabetical order.

Registering a remote will check to see if the string "?apikey=" exists
in the URL. If it does not, then the URL will not be uploaded.

The results of unmarking and marking can be found in the Remotes section
of the Admin webpage, where a string displays the status of the given
video segment.

All other use cases should be easily performed with the click of a 
button.
